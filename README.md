# placement-record-automation-system
This is my dbms sql project.


It is for the Center for Industrial Liasion & Placement (CILP), Thapar university which organizes placement for final year students.


The project includes student registration and company registration. Each student can apply for various companies coming for recruitments. Company are categorized in 3 Categories-Small Package, Medium Package, Dream Package. Person once placed in the category cannot apply in the same category but can apply in the higher category if it exists. Once the registration happens, the software calculates who are eligible for company. Companies are shown studentâ€™s ability according to their demand. Similarly, students are shown best companies suitable according to their abilities. After that the data of college alumni are shown to them, the student can contact them and contact record is maintained. After the placement procedure ends, result of selected ones is displayed and they are removed from placement competition and are added in the list of selected ones. The whole project focuses on making the placement management easier.
